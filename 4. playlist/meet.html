        <p class="letraMus">When I wake up<br>
            I can't even stay up<br>
            I slept through the day, fuck<br>
            I'm not getting younger<br>
            <br>
            But when I'm older<br>
            I'll be so much stronger<br>
            I'll stay up for longer<br>
            Meet me at our spot<br>
            <br>
            Caught a vibe<br>
            Baby, are you coming for the ride?<br>
            (The ride, the ride, the ride)<br>
            I just wanna look into your eyes<br>
            (Your eyes, your eyes)<br>
            I just wanna stay for the night, night, night<br>
            <br>
            When we take a drive<br>
            Maybe we can hit the 405<br>
            Hypnotized by the lights<br>
            Man, this must be the life<br>
            <br>
            When I go to sleep<br>
            I can't even fall asleep<br>
            Something's got ahold of me<br>
            Feel it taking over me<br>
            <br>
            But when I'm older<br>
            I'll be moving onward<br>
            I just got a drunk text<br>
            (Meet me at our spot)<br>
            <br>
            We caught a vibe (yeah, yeah)<br>
            Baby, are you coming for the ride?<br>
            (The ride, the ride, the ride)<br>
            When I look into your eyes<br>
            (Your eyes, your eyes)<br>
            I just wanna hold you all night (all night)<br>
            <br>
            Maybe we can take a drive (take a drive!)<br>
            Baby, we can hit the 405<br>
            Hypnotized by the lights<br>
            Man, this must be the life<br>
            <br>
            Meet me at our spot<br>
            Got something I wanna show you<br>
            Meet me at our spot<br>
            They can't find us there<br>
            <br>
