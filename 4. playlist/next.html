        <p class="letraMus">Every time I lose my voice<br>
            It's probably cause I'm singing about you<br>
            Been trying to find the words to say<br>
            But they're just another thing I seem to lose<br>
            Do you remember the time we got drunk in Versailles<br>
            And we lost our shit?<br>
            Tell me are we just waiting for each other to say<br>
            Let's do it all again?<br>
            <br>
            Cause' if there's one thing we're told, c'est la vie<br>
            But I miss you more each day you're not with me<br>
            And just know when I sleep<br>
            That I'm dreaming of the only place I wanna be<br>
            And where I wanna be is next to you<br>
            <br>
            I've been broken for so long<br>
            I need a break from trying to fix myself<br>
            Been running out of drugs to try<br>
            To try and fill the spaces that you left<br>
            We got too high in Paris<br>
            You were embarrassed when I made you dance<br>
            Tell me are we just waiting for the other to say<br>
            Let's do this all again<br>
            <br>
            Cause' if there's one thing we're told, c'est la vie<br>
            But I miss you more each day you're not with me<br>
            And just know when I sleep<br>
            That I'm dreaming of the only place I wanna be<br>
            And where I wanna be is next to you<br>
            <br>
            Remember the time we got drunk in Versailles<br>
            And we lost our shit<br>
            We got too high in Paris<br>
            You were embarrassed when I made you dance<br>
            Cause' if there's one thing we're told, c'est la vie<br>
            But I miss you more each day you're not with me<br>
            And just know when I sleep<br>
            That I'm dreaming of the only place I wanna be<br>
            Aaahh<br>
            (Are we just waiting)<br>
            For each other to say we should do this all again<br></p>
