        <p class="emicida">Harry Styles</p>
        <p class="letraMus">Maybe, we can<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            And we can treat people with kindness<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            <br>
            I've got a good feeling<br>
            I'm just takin' it all in<br>
            Floating up and dreamin'<br>
            Droppin' into the deep end<br>
            <br>
            And if we're here long enough<br>
            They'll sing a song for us<br>
            And we'll belong<br>
            <br>
            Maybe, we can<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            And we can treat people with kindness<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            <br>
            Giving second chances<br>
            I don't need all the answers<br>
            Feeling good in my skin<br>
            I just keep on dancin'<br>
            <br>
            And if we're here long enough<br>
            We'll see it's all for us<br>
            And we'll belong<br>
            <br>
            Maybe, we can<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            And we can treat people with kindness<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            <br>
            And it's just another day (and it's just another day)<br>
            And if our friends all pass away (oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
            It's okay (it's okay, it's okay)<br>
            It's okay (it's okay, it's okay, yeah)<br>
            Hey!<br>
            Here we go now<br>
            <br>
            Maybe, we can<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            And we can treat people with kindness<br>
            Find a place to feel good<br>
            <br>
            All we ever want is automatic all the time<br>
            All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time<br>
            All we ever want is automatic all the time<br>
            All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time<br>
            <br>
            Maybe, we can (all together now, one more time)<br>
            Find a place to feel good (oh, yeah)<br>
            And we can treat people with kindness (just a little bit of kindness)<br>
            Find a place to feel good (ow)<br></p>
